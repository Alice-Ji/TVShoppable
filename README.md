# Shoppable Ad Study: Social Media & Streaming TV

This project explores how **interactive advertising formats** (shoppable vs. non-shoppable ads) influence consumer attention and engagement across two major media environments: **social media feeds** and **streaming TV platforms**.

## Overview
Participants were exposed to custom-built advertising stimuli in two contexts:  
- **Social Media Feed:** Simulated scrolling environment with embedded shoppable vs. non-shoppable ads.  
- **Streaming TV:** Interactive video player replicating a connected-TV interface with clickable ad overlays.  

Participantsâ€™ behavior and responses were recorded to assess:  
- Interaction with ad elements (clicks, hover, time on screen)  
- Self-reported recall, recognition, and purchase intention  

## Research Questions
1. Do shoppable ads increase consumer attention and engagement compared to non-shoppable formats?  

## Methods
- **Platform:** Custom interactive ad environments built in HTML/JavaScript.  
- **Contexts Tested:** Social media feed simulation + streaming TV viewer simulation.  
- **Measures:**  
  - **Eye-tracking** (visual attention patterns)  
  - **Interaction logs** (clicks, hover, dwell time)  
  - **Surveys** (ad recall, recognition, purchase intent)  
- **Analysis:** Combined behavioral and self-report measures to model attention and engagement outcomes.  

## Findings (Preliminary)
- Shoppable ads generated more direct engagement (clicks, dwell time) than non-shoppable ads.  
- Effects varied by context: lean-forward vs. lean-back media environments produced different attention and interaction patterns.  

## Industry Relevance
- **Advertisers & Brands:** Provides evidence on how shoppable features influence attention and purchase intent across platforms.  
- **AdTech & Streaming Platforms:** Offers insights into user experience with interactive ad formats in both feed-based and lean-back environments.  
- **UX/Design Teams:** Demonstrates experimental methods for testing ad interactivity in controlled but realistic settings.
